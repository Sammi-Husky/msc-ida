IDA Processor Module and Loader for Smash 4 MotionScript Binary files (.mscsb)

I've created this module and licensed it under MIT in the hopes that the community will be able to make use of it in order to unlock the power of the MotionScript engine.

# Requirements

* Python 2.7
* IDA 6.3 or above (tested on 6.8)

# Installation

Copy mscsb.py to the /procs directory in your IDA installation folder, and mscsb_loader to the /loaders folder. If installed correctly you should get no error messages and simply pressing "Okay" should start the decompilation process.
